**_Sequelize-ORM Testing_**

**Description**
This project was created to learn Sequelize-ORM and to work with an Express JS API creating routes and handling SQL with Sequelize. This is a back-end project that has some pre-defined routes that can be queried to view users, photos, and photos tied to the user who created them.

**Installation**
This project can be installed by cloning the Git repo down to a folder on your computer. In that folder, then run:
```
npm install
```

This project has a `sample-config.json` file that will need to be edited to your local PostgreSQL username/password. Alternatively, the "dialect" can be changed to whatever database you utilize. Be sure to rename the `sample-config.json` file to `config.json`

Dev server can be run by running:
```
npm run dev
```

**Usage**

This project was created to test out creating an Express API, working with SQL utilizing JS via Sequelize, and running test calls with Postman.
